### About me

My name is C. Kamal and I am currently working as a Scientist in Theory and Simulations Lab, Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore, INDIA. This website contains information about me and my research. 

### Educations

- 2014 Ph. D. from Homi Bhabha National Institute (HBNI), Mumbai, India. Thesis title: “Ab initio Studies on Properties of Nanostructures”

- 2004 “Orientation Course in Science and Technology (OCES)”, from CAT Training School, RRCAT, Indore, India.

- 2002  Bachelor of Education, graduate in First Class from University of Madras, Chennai, India

- 2001 Master of Science (in Physics), graduated in First Class from University of Madras, Chennai, India

- 1999 Bachelor of Science (in Physics, allied subjects: Mathematics & Chemistry) graduated in First Class from University of Madras, Chennai, India

### Research Interest 
- Theoretically study and understand geometric, electronic, optical, vibrational and magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) systems made up of elements from various groups. From  ab initio electronic structure calculations, recently, predicted the stability of monolayered systems made up of group III, V and IV-VI elements (which are called aluminene, arsenene, and carbon selenide etc.)

- Computational study on similar properties of  bulk (transition metal oxides and alloys) and nano-materials (nanoclusters and  nanotubes) as well as bio-molecules.

- For theses purposes, the electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) / time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) have been performed by using several numerical codes namely, VASP, WIEN2k, Quantum Espresso, SIESTA, ADF, etc which have been installed in high-performance computing (HPC) cluster machines in our centre. 		

- Strong interest in writing and developments of numerical codes.
